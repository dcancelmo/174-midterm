## Information Architecture

### Ontology

The index page shows the user what is being described within the site, namely the city of Rochester, NY. The terminal area links to the information.

The details page contains an overview of the city including an "at a glance" area, history, economy, and education information.

Each of the sections (excluding the overview) contains 1 subsection about a particularly notable thing related to the subject (ex. University of Rochester is  subsection of Education).


### Taxonomy

The index has the site title, a form to sign-up for the newsletter, a link to the website's source for information, and a link to learn about Rochester.

In the details page there are four main headings: Overview, History, Economy, and Education.

Each heading has an aside containing pertinent information that is best presented quickly so as to not require lots of attention. Each heading (except Overview) also has a subjeading with a specfic item of note.


### Choreography

From the index page the eye follows the z pattern from the title, to the newsletter form, to the source to the link for information in the terminal area. As it is in the terminal area a user is likely to click to learn more.

From there the details page follows an F-pattern with the Rochester logo acting as bullet points for the headings and subheadings to grab attention and asides containing quick and easy to digest information. Once a reader reaches the bottom there is a prompt to signup for the newsletter that when clicked brings the user back to the top to sign-up.

The order of headings builds on previous headings. I feel knowing about the previous headings helps to udnerstand the next one. flowing from Overview to History to Economy to Education.
